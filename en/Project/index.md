# Projects

A **Project** is, as the name suggests, the unit for organizing a set of work as a single project. Projects can contain multiple assets such as the **Flow** type for data flows and the **InfoMotion** type for data visualization graphs.

The list of projects can be seen on the screen after logging in. Projects can be created with **Create Project**.
