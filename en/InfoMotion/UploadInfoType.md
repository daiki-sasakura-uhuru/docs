As stated the required files are `plugin.js`, `plugin.css` and `plugin.json`. 
Here you can choose to drag and drop or select files. 

If the files have been successfully uploaded 
a preview of the InfoMotion will be displayed along with the 
`sampleData` and `sampleSettings` from the plugin.json.

Now the Infomotion is loaded to Enebular let's see how we can 
connect it to a [DataSource]() and view/edit it in [Dashboard]().
