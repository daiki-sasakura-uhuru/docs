You can choose to drag and drop `plugin.js`, `plugin.css` and `plugin.json`. 

If the files have been successfully uploaded 
a preview of the InfoMotion will be displayed along with the 
`sampleData` and `sampleSettings` from the plugin.json.

Now the Infomotion is loaded to Enebular let's see how we can 
connect it to a [DataSource]() and view/edit it in [Dashboard]().
